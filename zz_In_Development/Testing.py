"""Convert features to Knowledge Graph entities and create a relationship.

This script expects a feature class (or layer) with exactly two features.
It converts each feature to a simple entity payload (properties + geometry JSON)
and then attempts to create the entities and a relationship in the Knowledge Graph.

Fallback behavior: if the live KnowledgeGraph API method for creating entities
is unavailable, the script will print the payloads so they can be uploaded manually.

Assumptions made:
- The KG object may not expose create methods with known names; we try a few
  common names and otherwise fall back to printing payloads.
- Geometry is stored and transmitted as Esri JSON (Shape JSON via arcpy).
